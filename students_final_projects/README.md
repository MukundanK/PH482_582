# Students Final Projects
Here you can add your final projects:

- one folder per team, so for group a it would be `root/students_final_projects/group-a`
- make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in order to "upload" your project
- Git and Github are valuable skills. However, if you don't know how to use git and github and also don't want to learn it now, feel free to e.g. upload your project on box and send an email to Marco, then he can upload it here.
- A good resource to learn git is [this lecture from the "Missing Semester"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok&t=1s). It teaches way more than what you need to know to be able to make the pull request.
